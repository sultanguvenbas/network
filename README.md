# network

# Description
You will learn how the IPv4 address and IPv6 address are divided according to the required IP addresses and the link-local address which is only significant on the local
network. Thatâ€™s why we can not ping from one network to another network using a link local address. Moreover, if you try to give the same network IP address to different interfaces, you will encounter an 'overlapping' error. Furthermore, you will see there are two options available to us in order to implement a password. They are 'enable password' and 'enable secret' and you will learn the different between them. You will also see that IoT devices, DNS server, Web server and telnet configuration settings are made and some conditions are added. And also, you can read more details in network.pdf .
